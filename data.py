#Explanation Of Code
# insert(data):
# A new node is generated and assigned the data specified in the parameters. In the event that the tree happens to be empty (root is None), the newly created node becomes the root of the tree. Otherwise, the tree is traversed recursively in search of a position for the new node. The new node is added as a child of the suitable parent node (either to the left or right depending on data comparison)      

# search(data):

# Begins at the core node (the present one). Progressively moves down the structural hierarchy thereby validating the data with that of the present node. In the event that the data is equivalent to the one stored in the node, returns the data filled node. If no similar data is found after all branches have been traversed, it returns None instead.

# preorder_traversal(node):

# Recursive approach that visits the node first, then its left subtree, and then its right subtree.
# Prints the node's data followed by a space for clarity.
# Calls itself recursively on the left and right subtrees to explore them further.

# inorder_traversal(node):

# Recursive approach that visits the left subtree first, then the node itself, and then the right subtree.
# More common for sorted data structures like Binary Search Trees (BSTs) where nodes are ordered in a specific way.
# Prints the node's data followed by a space for clarity.
# Calls itself recursively on the left and right subtrees to explore them further.

# postorder_traversal(node):

# Recursive approach that visits the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and then the node itself
